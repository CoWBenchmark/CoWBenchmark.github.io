Welcome to the **Circle of Willis** _(CoW) Benchmark_ joint-event for [MICCAI 2023](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/)!


We are two CoW benchmarking challenges with MICCAI 2023:
>
- 👑 [`CROWN`](https://crown.isi.uu.nl/): **C**i**R**cle **O**f **W**illis **IN**tracranial Artery Classification and Quantification
- 🐮 [`TopCoW`](https://topcow23.grand-challenge.org/): **Top**ology-Aware Anatomical Segmentation of the **C**ircle **o**f **W**illis for CTA and MRA

Together both challenges will organize a joint event called the "Circle of Willis Benchmarking Workshop" at the MICCAI Conference. In this half-day joint-event, we are excited to present **three clinical keynotes 🏥 🧠 on the topic of CoW**, followed by two 1.5 hours sessions to summarize and announce the results for each challenge. We will host a combined round-table discussion with all participants.
