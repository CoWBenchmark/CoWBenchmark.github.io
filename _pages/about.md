Welcome to the **Circle of Willis** _(CoW) Benchmarking_ joint-event for [MICCAI 2023](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/)!


We are two CoW benchmarking challenges with MICCAI 2023:
>
- [`CROWN`](#): **C**i**R**cle **O**f **W**illis **IN**tracranial Artery Classification and Quantification
- [`TopCoW`](#): **Top**ology-Aware Anatomical Segmentation of the **C**ircle **o**f **W**illis for CTA and MRA

Together our both challenges will organize a joint event called "Circle of Willis Quantification Benchmarking Workshop" at the MICCAI Conference. In this half-day joint-event, we will have a combined introduction and overview on the topic of CoW and both challenges, followed by two 1.5 hours sessions to summarize and announce the results for each challenge. We will host a combined round-table discussion with all participants. Finally, [`TopCoW`](#) and [`CROWN`](#) will share a subset of the data, namely 20 MRA scans for training and 10 for test. These datasets will be jointly annotated and evaluated by both challenges.

Our joint-event will take place in October in Vancouver Canada. Stay tuned for more information! For now, please register for our CoW challenges from their homepages at the links [`CROWN`](#) and [`TopCoW`](#) :sparkles:
